# Two Years at KodeCraft: Building a Door and Finding My Stride
"If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door." - Milton Berle

Two years ago, I built a door. I was comfortable in my previous job, a good company where I had learned a lot. Yet, a nagging feeling of stagnation was starting to creep in. The tech stack felt like it was aging, the path forward was hazy, and I knew deep down that I was capable of more. I was worried about getting stuck.

Then, a knock—or rather, a message. A former college classmate, Karl, reached out asking if I knew anyone suitable for a managerial role he was hiring for. I mentioned my team lead at the time, Sam. A week later, my phone buzzed again. It was Sam. He was joining Karl to build a new team at a company called KodeCraft, and he asked if I wanted to come along with him, Karl, Louie, and a few junior developers.

Hesitation hit me first. The thought of adapting to a new environment all over again was daunting. But then he mentioned the tech stack: the newest and most sought-after in the market. A spark of excitement cut through the uncertainty. I thought to myself, "If I don't do this now, this opportunity might never come back."

I took the leap. And it turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life.

## Year One: Building the Foundation (and with Rust!)
I walked through the doors of KodeCraft on August 1, 2023, with a mix of nerves and excitement. My mission was clear, but the main tool for the job was completely foreign to me: Rust. I had zero experience with it. In many places, that would be a dealbreaker. Here, it was an invitation. The team gave me the space and, most importantly, the trust to learn.

My first major project was "Jabra UI," a web application for an Option Quoter. The challenge? To write it entirely in Rust using the Leptos framework for the UI. It was like learning to swim by jumping into the deep end, but with the best lifeguards around. The company also entrusted me with a junior developer to mentor, which was an incredible opportunity to hone my leadership skills while solidifying my own understanding.

The environment was electric. Working alongside brilliant and competitive colleagues, especially Karl, one of the sharpest thinkers I’ve known since our university days, pushed me to be better every single day. That first year wasn't just about learning a new language; it was about a fundamental upgrade to my skills, my confidence, and my competitive edge. The culmination of this growth was when I was encouraged to lead a tech talk on the Jabra UI project. Public speaking has never been my forte, but I stood up there, explained our work, and answered questions. It was a massive boost to my communication skills (and I'm hoping for more opportunities, maybe with slightly less shaky notes next time!).

## Year Two: Resilience, Growth, and a Trip to Vancouver
Year two began with a gut punch. Jabra UI, my bread and butter and a project I had poured my heart into, was discontinued. I was devastated. The questions flooded my mind: Was it my fault? Could I have done more to save it? My confidence plummeted, and for a few days, my productivity ground to a halt.

This is where the true character of a company shines through. My bosses, Jacob and Karl, pulled us aside and told us not to worry, to see it as a part of the natural evolution of business, and to keep moving forward. Their support was the anchor I needed.

I was reassigned to a new team, the Market Data Team (which has since evolved into Cobble Stream), tasked with building applications to stream market data to our services. My confidence was still shaky, but the team's encouragement was unwavering. Within a month, I started to find my rhythm again. The new challenges were complex, but my passion for solving them returned stronger than before.

This year also brought a paradigm shift in our development process: a company-wide push to integrate AI into our daily workflows. This was a game-changer. It accelerated my learning, helped me debug complex issues, and unlocked new creative solutions. It taught me how to leverage powerful tools responsibly, ensuring I remained the driver. The ideas started flowing again, leading to the birth of our ambitious new project, "Cobble Stack." The company shared its vision with us, and it was exhilarating. It’s this constant pursuit of the new, the challenging, and the exciting that gets me out of bed in the morning.

The year ended on the highest of highs. Just last month, the entire team was sent to Vancouver for a work-and-vacation trip. It was an unforgettable experience that solidified our bonds and rewarded our hard work. It was the perfect capstone to a year of resilience and incredible growth.

## Technical Deep Dive: From Rust UIs to Data Streams
My journey at KodeCraft has been a masterclass in modern technologies. My proudest achievement from year one was mastering Rust and the Leptos framework. Rust's strict compiler and ownership model force you to think differently about memory and safety. Overcoming the initial steep learning curve to build a fluid, high-performance UI for Jabra was incredibly rewarding. It demonstrated KodeCraft's commitment to using the right tool for the job, even if it’s on the cutting edge.

In my second year, the challenge shifted from front-end interfaces to back-end performance with the Cobble Stream project. We're building low-latency, high-throughput systems to handle massive volumes of real-time market data. This involves deep dives into asynchronous programming, efficient data serialization, and robust error handling. A specific challenge I tackled was designing a fault-tolerant data ingestion pipeline that could automatically recover from upstream connection failures without losing a single message. Using tools like wasmCloud and IPC, we implemented a solution with backpressure and retry mechanisms that has proven to be incredibly resilient. The introduction of AI as a development partner has also been transformative, helping me prototype wasmCloud service definitions and write complex unit tests more efficiently than ever before.

## The KodeCraft Culture: Trust, Talent, and Teamwork
What truly sets KodeCraft apart is its culture. It’s not just about a list of values on a wall; it’s about how those values are lived out every day. There’s a profound sense of trust—trust to let an engineer learn a new language on the job, trust to give them ownership of critical projects, and trust that everyone is pulling in the same direction.

Collaboration is seamless. We have a flat-enough hierarchy that ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ones win. Working alongside people like Karl, Louie, Pau and Josef means I am constantly learning. The professional development here is organic; it happens through challenging projects, candid feedback, and opportunities like internal tech talks. The Vancouver trip is a perfect example of the company’s investment in our well-being and team cohesion, proving that work-life balance isn't just a buzzword here. It's a place built on mutual respect and a shared passion for building great things.

## Looking Forward: The Next Chapter
As I step into my third year, my focus is on making our Cobble Stream and Cobble Stack projects a resounding success. My goal is to deepen my expertise in distributed systems and contribute to the architectural decisions that will shape our platform for years to come.

To anyone new joining the team, my advice is this: embrace the challenge. It’s okay not to have all the answers. Be curious, ask questions, and trust the process and the people around you. I am incredibly excited about the company's future direction. The vision is bold, and I have no doubt that with this team, we can achieve it.
